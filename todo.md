### ToDo

Here's a list of todos for this project. Expect this to change often.

1. Add user status command:
  a. Preferably an embed.
  b. Should include status (online, idle, etc.), server joined date (would render s!joined obsolete), and Discord join date.
2. Add command to check channel permissions.
3. Move send calls out of typing context handlers
4. add a custom context subclass to make registering responses easier
